### Series

Sereis are implemented using [Jekyll's collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). So to add new series, following these steps:

1. Define a new collection in `_config.yml`, under `collections` configuration block

    ```yaml
    collections:
      demo_series:
        output: true
    ```

    Note that to make the change to `_config.yml` take effects, you **need to restart jekyll**.

2. Create the series (aka collection) folder `/_demo_series`. Note that the **folder name begin with `_`**

3. By adding new post under series folder, you add post under the corresponding series

## Deployment

See [Jekyll doc on deployment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/)

## That's it

Happy blogging!
